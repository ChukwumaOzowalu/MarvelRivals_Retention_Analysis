But with all the new heroes and the huge changes the game has gone through in the years since, I've recently come back to it and found that it's by far my favorite team shooter.

There are heroes for all different kinds of play styles and most heroes can adapt via the in-match loadouts and purchases to the situations that come up. (No tank? Pick up some extra HP and damage reduction since you'll likely be taking more damage, etc.)

I know the game systems have changed so that free-to-play players can't feasibly get all the heroes unlocked anymore so I can't recommend it for them, but for anyone who just buys the hero pack with all current heroes, it's a really great game with a lot of depth and a ton of fun with friends.",1,2022-02-14 01:35:22,True

Pros: 
-F2P, only cash items are cosmetics
-Amazing lore
-Varied champions designs, everything from lore to abilities to play style.
-You can win with almost any team composition. I have personally won games with all flanks.
-No matter how many matches I play, I always come back for more. In the last 3 days I've logged 8.9 hr
The community is helpful from the questions I've asked.

Cons: 
-Almost every cosmetic is Crystal instead of gold, and Crystals can be hard to grind. Luckily they added Trials Of The Realm, which has one challenge that nets you 50.
-Some champions, more specifically gun champions, are basically OP cuz of high fire rate. 
-Some champion abilities are BS, like one champion who summons a dragon which kills you in about .4 seconds.
-Only 3 game modes.

This game is so broken and rage inducing any game from your past that you hate you will love after playing this pile of bugs.

76561197972723876,"Paladins gets gameplay right. Some comparrisons with Overwatch.

Map Design:
Hi-Rez shows it has much more experience with action games like this through map design.  Although some might argue less interesting, the symmetric map layouts simply play better with much less choke points resulting in an experience that is much more dynamic and much less choked gameplay.

Blizzard wins with visual polish and there substantially larger development team shows what it is really possible.

Gameplay:
Hi-Rez wins due to better map layouts, more unique champion variety, higher (but not by much) time to kills (therefore more skill based), and most importantly less ultimate spam that totally alters the outcome of the match.  Some champions are very strong in lower skill games, some very strong in higher skilled matchups, overall there is a place where each can shine.

Although the idea of mounts in a game like this is kinda funny, they work well as a mechanic to get back into the action much quicker.

In Overwatch health packs are occasionally available for pickup.  Paladins has a time out of combat mechanic which grants health recovery.  I prefer the Paladins approach which results, in general, with more action less respawns.

Strategy:
Double edged sword for Hi-Rez.  In Paladins a game can be lost even before it's played.    Things that can result in a loss:
- Poor champion deck loadouts.  5 Cards with 15 possible points are chosen to establish a premade deck for a champion outside of gameplay.  Players can build decks to optimize champion strengths, or just the opposite and hinder their performance.
- Poor pre-match champion selection: champions cannot be changed or adapted mid match.  Weak or no front line pick?  Most of the time a loss.  No support pick, most of the time a loss.  
- Poor in-game item purchases.  Credits are earned during the match and can be spent to slightly enchance stats like damage reduction, attach strengths vs. shields or deployables, health steal, etc..  Poorly spend in-match credits can actually lead to a loss if there are enough poor choices on a team.

The Paladins experience is more rich as a result of the strategic decision making, but can also be more sour when teammates haven't taken the time to understand some of these basics.  

Overwatch is much more accessible for the beginner to these types of games.

Technical Performance:
Overwatch by far wins this category.  They have created an experience with substantially less glitches, UI bugs, and general problems.  Hi-Rez seems like it is forced into continued champion release patches to maintain similar numbers and it shows that they still have a long way to go to correct game bugs.  This can make for a frusterating experince when players are disconnected from matches while loading and don't understand they can reconnect.  

Overall this game is a great experience and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys shooter style action games with some strategy elements.",0,2018-04-20 01:16:30,True

This game used to be a much bigger dumpster fire than it is as of this review. A lot of bugs that were ignored by dev team for YEARS have finally been fixed. That being said, it's still got a long way to go. The focus is on quantity over quality and often new content is a 50/50 tossup of incredibly well executed skins/other items OR a bunch of lazy stuff that was obviously crunched into the patch.

HiRez has a pretty ""ignorant"" history as far as transparency and support for the community has gone. They're learning, but they still have made enough mistakes that this game will never truly be as amazing as it deserves to be - and I think that kinda sums up every veteran players' opinion: too little too late.

76561197965046404,"(1k hours in total, stopped using steam and started using the Hi-Rez launcher a long time ago)

This was a fun game once.  It had great unique characters, it was skill based, and it had outplay.  This last feature made Paladins extremely unique for a modern FPS.  You didn't just die if someone else pressed a button, it was what separated Paladins from Overwatch for me and it was what I genuinely enjoyed about the game.  Fragging people took a little bit of effort and actually felt rewarding.

Over the last year the skill based and outplay based components were chipped away.  Old champions got their mobility nerfed into the ground.  New champions have little to no mobilty.  Weapon attacks are far more confirmable, projectiles got sped up and have even larger hitboxes, hit scan weapons fire faster and or do more damage, the list goes on.  This game became another utterly brainless modern shooter and ultimately lived up to the meme of being ""Overwatch for poor people.""

What finally prompted this review was Hi-Rez's actions over the last month.  Keep in mind, I am an older gamer.  I remember the days of UT2k4 and Tribes.  I can understand if the modern gaming generation doesn't enjoy those sorts of games.  It's perfectly acceptable if a company changes the direction of their game to appease the majority of their playerbase.  It's another thing to push out an extremely buggy mess of a patch that contains security vulnerabilities (don't link your twitch) whose major changes the community has been completely against during the entire month of testing.

This game is a mess.  Most aspects that made it unique have been stripped away.  What's left is a game that is almost indistguishable from any other modern shooter except for the copious amounts of bugs and a new card system that is P2W for the casual mode.

[strike]This game was amazing. Keyword: was. Sure, it had bugs and balancing issues, but the game offered customization and strategy that no other modern FPS could offer. The character customization allowed for diverse playstyles, the focus on using credits to counter the other team was fun and rewarding, the character selection is huge and large updates are frequent. I could honestly say it was one of my favorite games.

Then OB64 came out. The character customization was turned from a fun strategy element into a grind-fest. Instead of prioritizing certain cards to better your playstyle, the game is centered around leveling up your cards with grinding and money. This makes the game extremely pay 2 win. The perks you get from buying cards sets you high above other players. Why even bother with this?

I have been enjoying this game quite a bit, but Hi-Rez has been gearing up to put predatory EA style pay-to-win lootboxes in the game. I simply cannot reccomend a game that participates in that kind of practice.",0,2017-12-02 18:51:56,True

Well done Hi-Rez. BB.

2022: it became extremely worse, now you can end up in some ridiculous dead end in the game lobby for several hours with no chance to change anything, well done Hi-Rez, maybe 100 new hero frames or some music will solve the problem (but I doubt it)",2,2017-11-18 17:43:58,False

Pro: If you like MOBA and it's customizability, then you'll probably like this.

Con: If you have friends who play Overwatch and is sucking Blizzard's c0ck then you should [strike] probably find new friends [/strike] create a new steam account to play, or prepare to be constantly ridiculed by said friends.

Sadly with OB64 Patch Note update #5 Hi-Rez has shown that they do in fact, NOT listen to their community and did the opposite of what the majority of players were screaming in their face. The new card system introduced in OB64 will unbalance both Casual and Competitive play. I can no longer recommend Paladins as a game for people to try out, it will be a waste of time and effort.",1,2017-10-04 13:39:52,False

76561197983482210,"Paladins is an interesting, dynamic team FPS with many heroes and loadouts appealing to many playstyles.
While it may seem like an Overwatch clone, the two games are different in many ways and feel different.
Game frequently receives content patches (new heroes, maps and cosmetic awards) and balance patches.

Though it received quite a flak after the infamous OB64 patch, recent developments show that the company is willing to take the game in right directions with freeing it from mechanics resembling P2W.

76561198068813331,"Well I dont dislike paladins per se, but it is generic. The maps are bland, the characters for most part cardboard personality. The cards system is interesting but make every character a incognito, you dont know the range, the duration, the additional effects of a character skills you guestmate, while it has it place I dont think a fast paced arena shooter is the right place for the system, maybe a moba is best place for it. All in all even if is in beta I can't recomend it the maps and characters are really a let down. And the direction developers are taking in last updates are not being new players friendly maybe they getting greed, dont know.",10,2017-06-02 15:51:11,False

Only things that suck (imo):

- The amount of time waiting for a Ranked match. The waiting on average for me has been 6-7 minutes. Plenty of times it's longer, and I'm not even in a high placement rank-wise.
