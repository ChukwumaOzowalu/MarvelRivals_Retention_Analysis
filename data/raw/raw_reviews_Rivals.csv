N/A,"I'm leaving a positive review just for how well the servers work on launch with millions of players. I've had 0 issues across the board connecting to matches, friends, etc. No weird drops, nothing. Other AAA studios should take note on how to launch a title like this!",N/A
N/A,"After being a long-time player of Overwatch and abandoning it due to the many issues with the game and Blizzard Activision, I've wanted a game that felt like its beginning. Marvel Rivals is that game--and more. It's very much a lot of fun to play, I love the engagement and art style. It's not perfect, but it's good.

Pros:
Familiar characters
Lovely art style
Free to play!
Reasonable battle pass

Cons:
Memory leaks (for now, hopefully they'll fix it)
Poor optimization
Competitive begins at bottom rather than placement matches
Cosmetics in store are pricey",N/A
N/A,"It's like Overwatch but it doesn't make me want to put my **** in the blender.

Also tons of baddies.

You don't need to know anything about Marvel to enjoy it. If you can shoot straight and figure out abilities you will have fun.",N/A

N/A,"A Game That Feels Complete on Day One

What do I mean by that? Most online multiplayer games are released unpolished, with many issues, little content, and greedy anti-consumer practices these days. That's what I mean by that title. Marvel Rivals is the opposite of that and I am genuinely impressed.

A Consumer-Friendly Game

The game came out with 33 characters ready for the players to enjoy. That's insane! I remember when Apex Legends came out with just 8 characters at launch. That number is still at 26 after 6 years. Not to mention that Apex Legends, being the best Battle Royale in the market still to this day, has been destroyed by terrible decisions made by EA over the 6 years and is now almost dead. Same goes with games like Battlefront II (another legendary game destroyed by EA), Overwatch, etc. And the thing is, unlike other hero-based games, in Marvel Rivals, every character is unlocked at the start for the player to enjoy. You are almost always expected to grind the characters if you don't want to spend real money to unlock them.

What's more is that the battle pass is 4.99$ and is not timed, so you can always purchase and get the old battle pass items. And you can literally earn in-game currency without spending a dime. So after seeing these examples, I can only admire Marvel Rivals more.


It's crazy how well they nailed this at launch, if every character is OP, every character is fun to play and balanced! So easy yet so effective. Great job. There are a handful of weak characters but I am sure they'll adjust them. Optimization should be a little bit better.


Marvel Rivals is a great game that feels complete on day one. Its consumer-friendly practices make it one of a kind in the gaming world and prove that you don't need to have greedy money-making strategies to make a successful game. I hope they don't screw it like many other examples before.

N/A,"A fresh take on the Overwatch formula, this game combines team-based abilities with a focus on accurate Marvel lore. The attention to detail in the characters and environments is impressive, complemented by destructible maps that enhance the gameplay. The fluid animations and polished visuals make it a standout experience, even if the hero shooter concept feels familiar.",N/A
N/A,"Remember how much fun overwatch used to be? This is at that stage right now, play it now before in a year tryhards and devs ruin it. Remember how people started hating on mercy for solo resing entire teams and people complained? They are hating jeff now. Remember people complaining about hanzo? They are hating hawkeye now. Peoples reactions has been shockingly close to of overwatchs so I'm led to believe that the same crap that happened to overwatch will happen to rivals.",N/A
N/A,"i remember kind of shrugging this game off back when i first heard about it because of how much of a sour taste overwatch left in my mouth. But after being convinced by a friend to download it I've become addicted.

Most of the heroes feel well fleshed out and cater to alot of different play styles very well.
Really my biggest issue is the varying skill ceiling with a couple of the heroes. It's really not fun to load into games and every single team has an iron fist and a scarlet witch, both characters who require little to no aiming or even brain power. idk maybe im just bad but i personally dont find it fun to have a character who can rush you and kill you by just pressing one button.

overall, i think most of the characters are pretty well balanced if anything id say get rid of iron fist's lock on melee and id say there isn't a whole lot wrong with this game's balancing.

Game looks great, feels great and I'm just PRAYING that the devs dont ♥♥♥♥ something up royally in the future considering the game just came out.",N/A
N/A,"!!! LOWER END PC USERS WARNING !!!

You are at a MASSIVE DISADVANTAGE when playing with lower FPS (lower than 100+) because the game's logic is tied to the FPS your game is running on. This can result in shorter jumps, slower attack speed, and even desyncs.

AND IF YOU THINK, that you can just go ""Potato Mode"" by lowering all the settings, you are WRONG. YOU CANNOT turn off a lot of graphical settings in this game, you can't even turn off screenspace shadows and reflections because of them being the lowest option in the dropdown menu

As a cherry on top, the field of view is also tied to the resolution of your monitor, which means having a wider screen will give you more area to see, a very unusual choice for a competitive game

So if you have a subpar PC, a non state of the art build, DO NOT EXPECT ANY FORM OF COMPETITIVE INTEGRITY WHEN PLAYING THE GAME",N/A
