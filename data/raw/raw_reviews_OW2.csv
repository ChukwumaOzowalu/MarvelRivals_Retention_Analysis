76561198038603402,"I have been a die hard fan of Overwatch since release, I'm a collector of all things overwatch, avid reader of lore and just love all the characters in this game. But if you are a new player and are thinking of getting into this game...I would suggest you look elsewhere, the game doesn't allow for you to have any fun, it is constantly in competitive mode even in quick play. You aren't even allowed to leave casual quickplay games without the game putting you into a temporary ban. When the stars align and everything goes right,this game feels euphoric and addicting, but that is few an far between and the times in between make you feel so low you just don't know what to do with yourself.

TL:DR 
If you want to feel like an addict, trying to get that next high, with awful times in between, Overwatch might just be your game.",0,2024-12-25 17:40:22,False

The promised story mode was lackluster and nothing like any story of a story game.
Also: being required to pay €10 for changing your nickname a second time. Peak capitalism.
