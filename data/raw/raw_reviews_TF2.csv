76561197978409269,"TF2 is a timeless classic. My time in this game from 2009 to 2012 was awesome.

Stopped playing when the games roadmap changed from fun team shooter with a competitive base to a hat collecting simulator and then unbalanced weapon generator. I believe when the Liberty launcher released is when I finally uninstalled (this was after dealing with the FaN on scout for half a year)

Some of the worst updates to ever touch the game. I am sure there's been dozens of updates since then but I could never enjoy it the same. Just hundreds of hours perfecting classes to have easier ones release undermining them.

Anyway sure the game is still tons of fun to play for the new generation. I'm surprised a team fortress 3 on source 2 hasn't come yet. Also I would pay money to go back to the version I used to play in 2010.",0,2024-12-17 19:03:11,True
